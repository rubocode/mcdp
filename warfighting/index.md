### War
* A violent struggle between two hostile, independent, and irreconcilable wills, each trying to impose itself on the other.
* Shaped by human nature and is subject to the complexities, inconsistencies, and peculiarities which characterize human behavior.
* An interactive social process of continuous mutual adaptation, of give and take, move and counter move.

### Friction
* The force that resists all action and saps energy.
* Makes the simple difficult and the difficult seemingly impossible.
* The very essence of war as a clash between opposed wills creates friction.
* Mental or physical.
* Internal or external.

### Uncertainty
* All actions in war take place in an atmosphere of uncertainty - fog of war.
* Cannot be eliminated or even come close to it.
* At best, we can hope to determine possibilities and probabilities.
* Good judgement is vital.

### Risk
* Dealing with uncertainty involves the estimation and acceptance of risk.
* Risk is equally common to both action and inaction.
* Risk may be related to gain; greater potential gain often requires greater risk.
* The practice of concentrating combat power toward the main effort necessitates the willingness to accept prudent risk elsewhere.

### Nonlinearity
* Causes and effects can be disproportionate.
* Minor incidents or actions can have decisive effects.
* Outcomes of battles can hinge on the actions of a few individuals.

### Fluidity
* Each episode in war is the temporary result of a unique combination of circumstances, presenting a unique set of problems and requiring an original solution.
* Nevertheless, no episode can be viewed in isolation.
* Each episode merges with those that precede and follow it, creating a continuous, fluctuating flow of activity replete with fleeting opportunities and unforeseen events.

### Disorder
* In an environment of friction, uncertainty, and fluidity, war gravitates naturally toward disorder.
* It is precisely this natural disorder which creates the conditions ripe for exploitation by an opportunistic will.
* The best we can hope for is to impose a general framework of order on the disorder, to influence the general flow of action rather than to try to control each event.

### Planning
* Must fight effectively despite uncertainty.
* Develop simple and flexible plans.
* Plan for likely contingencies.
* Develop standard operating procedures.
* Foster initiative among subordinates.

### Mindset
* Fight effectively despite the existence of friction.
* Minimize self-induced friction.
* Your will helps you overcome friction.
* You prevail over friction through persistent strength of mind and spirit.
