### Style
* Leaders at all levels are responsible for their own learning while
supporting their subordinates' development.
* Every Marine is either a leader or a future leader, whether by rank
or by their experience and influence on others.
* Seek learning opportunities for yourself and your team.
* An excellent way to master a topic is to endeavor to teach it well to others.

### Subordinates
* Learning is necessary to leadership - strong leaders promote learning
in subordinates.
* Leaders recognize that the higher they progress, the more time that they
must devote to leading others â€” including others' learning experiences.
* At the same time, leaders recognize that learning is critical to their
responsibilities at higher levels as well.

### Quotes
> ... leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.  
> **John F. Kennedy**

> ... throughout history, [the difference] between brilliantly performing armies
> and mediocre ones has always [depended] on a small handful of combat leaders.  
> **John Boyd**

### Foster & Encourage
* Leaders foster learning by engaging their Marines, taking interest in their well-being, and supporting their professional development.
* In combat, subordinates must assume responsibility when their leaders become casualties.
* It is the responsibility of leaders, therefore, to mentor and develop the next generation of Marine leaders to prepare them to assume greater leadership roles.

### Cultivating
* Leaders do not wait for mistakes or failures to highlight a learning opportunity.
* They actively identify learning opportunities as they lead Marines in everyday duties so that their Marines learn to identify future learning opportunities on their own.
* We cannot rightly expect subordinates to exercise boldness and initiative in the field when they are accustomed to being over-supervised in garrison.

### Teaching & Leading
* Marines who cannot teach will struggle as leaders.
* Strong leaders do not berate a subordinate for making the first mistake; they turn mistakes into teachable moments.
* It is the leader's responsibility to recognize, act on, and correct the mistakes by turning them into learning opportunities.
* It is far better to learn in a training environment than to make mistakes when deployed.

### Relationships
* The relations between officers and enlisted men should in no sense be that of superior and inferior, nor that of master and servant, but rather that of teacher and scholar.
* Officers, especially commanding officers, are responsible for the physical, mental, and moral welfare, as well as the discipline and military training, of the young men under their command.

### Feedback
* Leaders provide effective constructive feedback for clarity and understanding.
* The goal is not a simplistic discussion of the "right" answer according to that leader's personal views.
* It is important to develop greater self-awareness, an understanding of the situation and task, and to be able to adapt the lessons learned to future situations.

### Humility
* You can learn from anyone if you are ready and willing to learn.
* However, ego can hinder learning.
* Leaders recognize that humility is a part of the career-long learning process.
* Effective leaders also recognize that they are not an expert in every topic and seek out those who are experts and learn from them, regardless of relative rank or position.
