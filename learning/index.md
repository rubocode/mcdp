### Definition
* Learning is the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes through study, experience, or instruction and includes both training and education.
* A never-ending progression that includes understanding why something is important — the intent of learning.
* Learning is much more than gathering information or reciting facts; it includes cognitive, physical, social, emotional, ethical, and cultural components.

### Accomplishment
* We earn the trust of others by demonstrating competence, a sense of responsibility, loyalty, and self-discipline.
* Competence is having sufficient knowledge, judgement, and skills to perform a particular duty, job, or function.
* Training prepares you to deal with the known factors.
* Education prepares you to deal with the unknown factors.
* Both are needed for readiness and effectiveness.

### Intelligence
* Maneuver warfare requires intelligent leaders at all levels who possess a bias for intelligent action.
* Success in warfare depends on developing an intellectual edge to accurately recognize cues, quickly make sense of information, and respond effectively.
* This intellectual edge is based on developed knowledge and experience that allows you to shape conditions and events to your advantage.

### OODA
* The warfighter who recognizes what is happening, adapts to the situation, and then makes effective decisions in the shortest amount of time will typically have an advantage.
* Observe your environment to recognize key cues, synthesize these cues to orient and quickly make sense of the information in order to decide and act — and then start the cycle again as you observe the effects of your actions.

### Application
* Includes effectively communicating decisions to your teams.
* Use skills such as critical thinking, reasoning, viewing situations from multiple perspectives, and visualizing the battlespace in nonlinear terms.
* Determine the best course of action within operational and tactical time constraints.

### Judgement
* You must understand how the body and mind respond to fear and stress so that you can better control your responses in any situation.
* Combat can challenge unit cohesion and present you with a variety of moral and ethical dilemmas.
* You develop strong mental, moral, spiritual, and ethical understanding because they are as important as physical skills when operating in the violence of combat.

### Competence
* Time spent learning how to effectively think and solve problems is time well invested.
* You must build the skills to recognize potential problems, reason, and think critically.
* Critical thinking is the reflective part of that reasoning which includes inference, evaluation, interpretation, and explanation.

### Intent
* Develop the temperament to persevere amidst uncertainty and the mental agility to succeed in fluid and chaotic situations.
* Understand the dynamic and complex situation from multiple perspectives to determine how to exploit an advantage.
* Understand the situation and execute actions to support and achieve the commander's intent.

### Principles
* Know yourself and seek self-improvement.
* Be ready and willing to learn.
* Understand why you are learning.
* Provide and receive constructive feedback.
